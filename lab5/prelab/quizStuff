(4). Draw a diagram to show the control flow of P1, which executes:

     int pid = getpid();       in Umode space

Required steps: YOU explain how each step leads to the next:
			

1. syscall(0,0,0,0) in C  			

	syscalls can't be done in C so we go to ts.s

2. syscall: in ts.s
			stmfd sp!, {lr}
			swi #0
			ldmfd sp!, {pc}

3. where does it go to ts.s?
	goes to svc_entry because of svc interrupt

4. svc_entry:  
	-> svc mode with svc stack. Save user mode process
	->enter svc.c
	syscall happens
	goes into svc handler, switches on 0 (provided from syscall)

5. r = kgetpid();
	r is return value of kernel function return
	r returns to goUmode

6. goUmode:
	replaces r0 in kstack with r

7. how does pid get returned to (1)?
		reading r0 after goUmode completesps
